# Repository: learnings-and-certificates

This is a public repository containing all the certificates obtained for all the online courses I have seen. The main purpose is to show the topics I learn on to improve my systems engineering skills and the different sources of information I use to keep abreast of changes in the industry.

# Professional Summary

As a professional in systems engineering and software development I have accumulated experience in different languages (Java, Python, JavaScript, C++, Go) and programming paradigms (Object Oriented, Event Oriented, Functional, Aspect Oriented), design, creation and integration of applications in different web communication standards (Rest, Restfull, WebSocket, RPC) under synchronous and asynchronous models, databases (NoSql, Document, SQL), operating systems (Linux, Windows), containers (Docker, Kubernetes), cloud (AWS, GCP, Heroku) and artificial intelligence (Machine Learning, PLN).
